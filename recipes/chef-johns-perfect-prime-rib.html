        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Use my easy "mathematical method" for cooking prime rib, and you'll be rewarded with the best prime rib that's perfectly pink and delicious. For the math to work, you must leave the beef out at room temperature for at least 6 hours. If you've ever carved into a prime rib at a big holiday meal expecting a juicy, perfectly pink interior only to discover a dry, overcooked roast, this recipe is for you. Here are some tips from Chef John to get you started: </p>
        <h2>Prime Rib Tips</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>This simple, foolproof "mathematical method" for making the very best prime rib will greatly increase your chances of success. Here is the formula: <strong><em>Multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes.</em></strong> For me it was 5.35 x 5 = 26.75 minutes, which we round up to 27.</li>
            <li>You'll cook your room-temperature prime rib at 500 degrees F for exactly that many minutes. (Twenty-seven minutes, in my case.) Then turn off the oven and <strong><em>wait 2 hours without opening the door</em></strong>. When the time's up, remove the prime rib and slice into the most perfectly medium-rare meat you've ever seen. See? That's all it takes to make foolproof prime rib cooked to a perfect pink that's somewhere just a shade under medium rare.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Just make sure you're starting with a prime rib that has been brought to room temperature!</em></strong> This is critical in order for the math to work!</li>
            <li>Serve your prime rib with <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/221957/beef-au-jus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chef John's Beef Au Jus</a> and <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/25887/horseradish-sauce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Horseradish Sauce</a>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (4 pound) bone-in prime rib roast (room temperature)</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
            <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place prime rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, 2 to 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until well blended. Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. Season roast generously with kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Roast the 4-pound roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. (If your roast is larger or smaller than 4 pounds, multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Turn the oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed, let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve.</li>
