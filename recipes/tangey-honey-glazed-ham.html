    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This honey-glazed ham recipe makes it easy to create a showstopping entree without the fuss. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe:</p>
    <p>Start by placing an uncovered ham in a roasting pan. Cook the ham at 325 degrees F for two hours. Remove ham from the oven for glazing. Combine honey, clove, pineapple juice, and Dijon mustard, whisking ingredients over high heat. Once the glaze comes to a boil, reduce heat and simmer the mixture for 5-10 minutes. Allow the glaze to cool slightly before tasting and adjusting seasonings — add more lemon juice or honey for elevated sweetness and acidity. Brush the baked ham every 10 minutes for 30-45 minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (10 pound) fully-cooked, bone-in ham</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup pineapple juice</li>
        <li>⅓ cup honey, or more to taste</li>
        <li>⅓ large orange</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons lemon juice, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place ham on a rack set in a roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>While the ham is baking, combine brown sugar, pineapple juice, and 1/3 cup honey in a saucepan. Zest orange into the saucepan, then squeeze in the juice.
